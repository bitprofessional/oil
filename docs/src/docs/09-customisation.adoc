== Customisation

=== Supported A/B Testing with us
If you want to optimize and test your OIL installation with our Kameleoon A/B testing, you also need to include the right kameleoon script into your website, which will alter the optics and behaviour of OIL according to the test and your specific environment.

An example link would look like:
[source,html]
----
<script type="text/javascript" src="//static-bp.kameleoon.com/css/customers/xxxxxxxxxxx/0/kameleoon.js"></script>
----

Instead of xxxxxxxxxxx the right hash needs to be present, so Kameleoon knows which website it deals with. When we setup OIL A/B testing on your page this hash needs to be generated within Kameleoon.

=== Your own A/B Testing

For setting up A/B testing in your own environment, the following information could come handy.

==== Enabling OIL for a specific variant only
For testing you can also use the preview mode to disable OIL by default and enable it in certain variants.

Add the following standard configuration to your website, which will disable OIL by default:
[source,json]
----
<script id="oil-configuration" type="application/configuration">
  {
    "preview_mode": true,
  }
</script>
----

For enabling it in a variant you need to replace the configuration and trigger OIL to reload it. As part of your variant
insert a customized version of this script:
[source,javascript]
----
<script type="text/javascript">
    (function () {
        var config = {
            "preview_mode": false,
            "label_intro_heading": "Please confirm!",
            "label_button_yes": "Of course"
        };
        var oldScript = document.getElementById('oil-configuration');
        if (oldScript) {
            oldScript.parentNode.removeChild(oldScript);
        }

        var head = document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0];
        var script = document.createElement('script');

        script.id = 'oil-configuration';
        script.type = 'application/configuration';
        script.text = JSON.stringify(config);

        head.appendChild(script);
        window.AS_OIL.reload();
    }());
</script>
----

OIL is supposed to come with legal texts that shouldn't be altered, except the main heading, button labels and some additional texts. Nevertheless, all labels can
be overwritten, even the default ones, in the OIL configuration block (see chapter <<Language label configuration>>).

==== "Thank you" Screen
If you are performing A/B tests on the OIL Layer while not having the tracking disabled technically, we recommend to
additionally insert this customized "Thank you"-Layer javascript code your website.

This code will listen to OIL events to show another window after the user finished the conversion process explaining the nature of the test.

[source,javascript]
----
(function () {

    // Cross browser event handler definition
    var eventMethod = window.addEventListener ? 'addEventListener' : 'attachEvent';
    var messageEvent = eventMethod === 'attachEvent' ? 'onmessage' : 'message';
    var eventer = window[eventMethod];

    // Callback to be executed when event is fired
    function receiveMessage(event) {
        function eventDataContains(str) {
            return JSON.stringify(event.data).indexOf(str) !== -1;
        }

        if (event && event.data && (eventDataContains('oil_opt'))) {
            var htmlCode = '<div class="as-oil-content-overlay">'
                + '<div class="as-oil-l-wrapper-layout-max-width">'
                + '<div class="as-oil__heading">'
                + 'Thank you for your feedback!'
                + '</div>'
                + '<p class="as-oil__intro-txt">'
                + 'We as a company take your privacy very seriously. In order to learn your expectations we '
                + 'currently conduct this survey. Thank you for your understanding!'
                + '</p>'
                + '<div class="as-oil-l-row as-oil-l-buttons">'
                + '<div class="as-oil-l-item">'
                + '<button class="as-oil__btn-soi as-js-optin as-close-ty-button" onclick="closeOil()">'
                + 'Close'
                + '</button>'
                + '</div>'
                + '</div>'
                + '</div>'
                + '</div>';

            var thankYouNode = document.createElement('div');
            thankYouNode.id = "as-oil-thank-you";
            thankYouNode.innerHTML = htmlCode;
            thankYouNode.setAttribute('class', 'as-oil');
            document.body.appendChild(thankYouNode);
        }
    }

    // Register event handler
    eventer(messageEvent, receiveMessage, false);
}());

=== Adding Scripts programmatically

==== Adding oil.js configuration
[source,javascript]
----
var oldScript = document.getElementById('oil-configuration');
if (oldScript) {
  oldScript.parentNode.removeChild(oldScript);
}

var config = {
  preview_mode: true
};
var head = document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0];
var script = document.createElement('script');

script.id = 'oil-configuration';
script.type = 'application/configuration';
script.text = JSON.stringify(config);

head.appendChild(script);
----

=== Tracking user interaction with OIL

Sometimes it may be interesting to know how users interact with the consent layer provided by OIL. To get this information it is required
to connect the Opt-In Layer with a tracking service. Fortunately, it is very easy to achieve this. This chapter describes the necessary
steps using the example of Google Analytics.

To be informed about special events or user interactions relating to the layer you can use the event mechanism provided by OIL (see chapter
<<OIL Events>>). To propagate these events to your tracking service (here: Google Analytics) you should add the following event handler
to your page:


[source,javascript]
----
  // Cross browser event handler definition
  var eventMethod = window.addEventListener ? 'addEventListener' : 'attachEvent';
  var messageEvent = eventMethod === 'attachEvent' ? 'onmessage' : 'message';
  var eventer = window[eventMethod];

  // Callback to be executed when event is fired
  function receiveMessage(event) {
    var eventData = JSON.stringify(event.data);
    // Examinate event and select it if it was sent by OIL
    if (typeof eventData === 'string' && eventData.indexOf("oil_") === 1) {
      // Propagate event to Google Analytics
      ga('send', 'event', {
        eventCategory: 'OIL',
        eventAction: eventData
      });
    }
  }

  // Register event handler
  eventer(messageEvent, receiveMessage, false);
----

It is recommended to integrate this code snippet before the import statement for the Opt-In Layer. This ensures that the handler is already
active when the layer fires its first event. The handler examinates incoming events and selects those sent by the layer (detectable by
their name prefix `oil_`). If such an event was detected it is propagated to Google Analytics using its API call `ga`. To be able to create
specific dashboards for OIL events the handler uses `OIL` as event category. The event name is propagated to Google Analytics as event action.
These data are already sufficient to create some useful dashboards as shown in the following screenshots:

image::src/images/ga_dashboard_all_events.png[Google Analytics Dashboard showing information about all detected OIL events]

image::src/images/ga_dashboard_events_by_actions.png[Google Analytics Dashboard showing information for specific OIL events]

For details how to create plots, tables and dashboards in Google Analytics please consult documentation provided by Google.

If you want to use another tracking service, you can use the event handler shown above as well. You only have to replace the Google Analytics
API call by the corresponding API call of your tracking service. If you are not interested in propagation of all OIL events, you can easily
change the code to select your events by name. See chapter <<OIL Events>> for the complete list of events sent by OIL.
